                    <div class="professional-text-block">
                        <p><strong>Fundamental Labor Rights and Duties:</strong> <vh>The Statute defines the basic rights of workers, such as the right to effective work, non-discrimination, physical integrity, and professional training. Correspondingly, it establishes duties such as fulfilling the specific obligations of the position, observing health and safety measures, and acting in accordance with contractual good faith.</vh></p> <!-- Translated -->
                        <p><strong>The Employment Contract:</strong> <vh>This law regulates the different types of contracts (permanent, temporary, training), specifying the formal and content requirements, the duration of the contract, and the probationary period applicable at the beginning of the employment relationship. It also establishes the rights and duties of the worker when entering into the contract.</vh></p> <!-- Translated -->
                        <p><strong>Working Time:</strong><vh> It sets the maximum duration of the ordinary working day, as well as the mandatory minimum rest periods between workdays and the weekly rest. It also addresses the regime for overtime, night work, shift work, and the fundamental right to a period of paid annual leave, which will be at least 30 calendar days.</vh></p> <!-- Translated -->
                        <p><strong>Salary and Wage Guarantees:</strong> <vh>The Statute defines the concept and structure of salary and establishes the National Minimum Wage (SMI) as a non-derogable minimum amount for all workers. It also regulates the form, place, and time of salary payment, and wage guarantees such as partial non-attachability and protection through the Wage Guarantee Fund (FOGASA).</vh></p> <!-- Translated -->
                        <p><strong>Modification, Suspension, and Termination of the Contract:</strong> <vh>The regulation covers substantial modifications of working conditions, both individual and collective, and functional and geographical mobility. Furthermore, it details the various causes for contract suspension (e.g., mutual agreement, temporary incapacity, maternity/paternity leave, leave of absence) and the different forms of contract termination, including resignation, mutual agreement, objective causes, and disciplinary dismissal.</vh></p> <!-- Translated -->
                        <p><strong>Collective Representation of Workers:</strong><vh> It regulates the establishment and operation of unitary worker representation bodies in the company, such as staff delegates and works councils. Likewise, it addresses trade union representation through union sections and union delegates, detailing their powers, guarantees, and the fundamental right to assembly and collective bargaining.</vh></p> <!-- Translated -->
                        <p><strong>Faults and Sanctions (Disciplinary Regime):</strong><vh> The Statute allows employers to sanction workers' labor breaches. These sanctions must comply with the gradation of faults (minor, serious, very serious) and the corresponding sanctions established in legal provisions or the applicable collective agreement. It is imperative to follow an adversarial procedure when imposing sanctions for serious or very serious faults, guaranteeing the worker's right to defense.</vh></p> <!-- Translated -->
